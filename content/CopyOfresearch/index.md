## Research Themes

Dr Brendan Gabrielâ€™s research focuses on:

- Circadian regulation of skeletal muscle metabolism
- Exercise timing, chronotherapy, and metabolic disease
- Mechanisms linking mitochondrial dynamics and energy expenditure
- Role of **Pla2g4e** in muscle ageing, obesity, and Type 2 Diabetes
- Application of omics (transcriptomics, lipidomics, spatial profiling)

## Current and Proposed Projects

- **Pla2g4e in healthy ageing**  
  Investigating the role of the phospholipase gene *Pla2g4e* in regulating skeletal muscle mitochondrial dynamics, metabolism, and age-related decline in function. *(BBSRC New Investigator application submitted)*

- **GLP-1 receptor agonists and muscle mass**  
  Exploring the effects of GLP-1RAs on skeletal muscle mass loss in clinical and experimental settings.

- **Chrono-exercise and metformin**  
  N-of-1 studies and controlled interventions exploring time-of-day effects of exercise and metformin in people with Type 2 Diabetes.

- **Shift work and cardiovascular health**  
  Lipidomics, wearable data, and cardiac imaging to assess CVD risk in shift workers and the effect of exercise timing.
